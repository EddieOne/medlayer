# Using a Neural Network to Understand Micro Expressions

The research focused on the excited or aroused micro expression. However, other emotional states are also possible to detect even within the same neural network. The data source was manually collected from data samples found online. Most data was from female faces, however, the algorithm was able to generalize to male faces during evaluation. Training only one emotion led to a very high accuracy of 99% surpassing that of normal human ability. Training on a small set of categories meant that the training process was very easy to reach high accuracy. However, with more emotions in the same model, the training difficultly increases. Some research will claim that complex emotions can be reduced to four or five, sometimes twelve emotions like anger, fear, sadness, and joy. However, this oversimplification is not needed for neural networks. Some other interesting emotions to understand are dispair, loving, disappointment, confusion, and nervousness. Using micro-expressions alone, complex emotions can be easily detected. However, there are some noted caveats like most emotion is hidden until a certain amount of stimulus is reached. For example, while detecting excitement in my own face, most of the time the muscles are in a resting position almost as if hidden behind a wall. However, after speaking with someone for 30 seconds to two minutes, the facial muscles tend to become more expressive. While mass surveillance may be possible (although unethical), it also requires a source of stimulus. One notable observation was that yawning would trigger false positives for excitement due to the same muscles being used as those during sexual orgasm. The facial muscles involved are two points between the eyebrows and two points at either edge of the lips. These muscles will tighten during times of excitement and the mouth and eyes may be open at a comparable amounts to each other as if in a relaxed state. In conclusion, neural networks are capable of detecting complex emotional states using facial images. By deeply understanding emotional states it can help to better understand human behavior such as yawning which appears to be a mechanism to release stress, especially from sexual desire. In addition, to signaling tiredness and increasing oxygen supply. Neaural network can be used in the medical and psychology fields to better understand human behavior. Our of fear of misuse, HealthLayer will be retracting the research code. However, this technology will likely find its way into mobile devices where camera apps could automatically take pictures that look more attractive by waiting until a frame where the person in a positive emotional state.
